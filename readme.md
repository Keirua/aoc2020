My solutions to advent of code 2020, in python

Some of the cool problems with a reasonnably clean solutions are:
 - 7 (the parsing is not very interesting. The counting part was fun, it involves graph traversal using BFS and DFS)
 - 8 (program parsing and running). The first part is straightforward, the 2nd part does add much
 - 10b (10b2 has some notes, that's dynamic programming)
 - 13b (solved with chinese remainder theorem, which requires extended gcd)
 - 14b (generating every possible bit combinations)

 - [Jonathan Paulson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuWLIm0l4sDpEe28t41WITA)'s channel. One of the best competitors codes then explains its solutions every day. That's very impressive to watch, and the explanations are a goldmine to learn things.
